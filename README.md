# React Utils

Various general purpose utilities for your React app that I have found the need for.

* `@seamusleahy/const-value-hook`: Useful for storing objects you want to persistent from render to render
* `@seamusleahy/init-hooks`: Running code only on the first render of a component
* `@seamusleahy/null-component`: Display reason why `null` was returned in React Dev Tools
* `@seamusleahy/pointer-down-then-up`: Replacement for `onClick` with pointer events
* `@seamusleahy/values-changes-hooks`: Keeps track of when values change between renders
